# ðŸŽ“ Singleton Design Pattern ðŸŽ“

This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern.

## Problem ðŸ¤”

We want to create a shopping cart for our e-commerce website, but we want to ensure that there is only one instance of the shopping cart throughout the website, so that all the products that the user adds to their cart are saved in a single cart instance.

## Solution ðŸ’¡

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. The shopping cart will be implemented as a Singleton, so that there is only one instance of the cart throughout the website.
