# 🎓 Learn Design Patterns with Node.js 🎓

Welcome to Learn Design Patterns! This is a fun and engaging repository that will help you learn how to use design patterns effectively in your Node.js projects. 😎

## What are Design Patterns? 🤔

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They help you write better code by providing proven solutions that you can use to solve common problems.

## How Does This Repository Work? 💡

This repository is a collection of Node.js projects, each of which demonstrates a different design pattern. Each one comes with a README file that explains the problem the pattern solves and how it is implemented in the project.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine and explore the projects in the `projects` directory. Each project is a standalone Node.js application that demonstrates a specific design pattern.

## Contributing 🤝

If you'd like to provide feedback or corrections to existing projects, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. 🤗

## Acknowledgments 🙏

This repository was inspired by [Christopher Okhravi's videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ChristopherOkhravi) & the book "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates, and Kathy Sierra.
